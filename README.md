# MovieRecommendation
MovieRecommendation is an recommendation engine for movies built using the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). It takes a movie as an input, and returns a list of the movies in the dataset that are most similar to it.

## Used Tools
This project is developed in Python, using the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Pyplot
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Fuzzywuzzy

## Data
This engine is trained on data from the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/), more specifically, on the `movie.csv` and `rating.csv` files of the dataset. This files must be downloaded in the root folder for the model to train. Firstly, this information was used to generate data visualizations in order to learn more about the dataset.

## Model
We've tried two approaches for generating movie recommendations.

### Collaborative Filtering
The first approach is to use the **k-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm to identify similar movies. This is performed by creating a utility matrix that relates movies and users with the rating given to each film, ignoring the rest of the movie attributes. This works based on the premise that if a user has rated two movies highly, it makes sense to use one of the movies as a recommendation for the other. A downside to this approach is that movies are required to have enough ratings for the predictions to be accurate (cold-start problem).

### Content-based filtering
The second approach consists in using **cosine similarity** on a matrix composed by the movie genres. This avoids the need for having enough reviews, but may have less sophisticated results than collaborative filtering.

### Data Cleaning and Usage
Data for both movies and ratings comes in tabular form. For the collaborative approach, the user, movie, and rating for any one particular review (from the `rating.csv` file) are used. For content-based filtering, the genre from the `movie` table is used.

The relationship between a movie ID and its name (stored in the `movie` table) is also used separately in order to ease the use of the solution and obtain more readable results, as the models by themselves receive and output a movie ID, not a movie name. The `fuzzywuzzy` package is also used to allow recommendations to be generated even if the input movie title is mispelled.

## Performance
Below are the perfomance metrics for both approaches

These metrics are calculated using a test set of actual user interactions, which are compared with the recommendations generated by both approaches.

While these metrics suggest excellent performance, it's important to consider the following:
1. **Overfitting:** Perfect scores might indicate overfitting, especially if the evaluation was done on a small or non-representative test set. Ensure that the evaluation is performed on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset.
2. **Real-World Performance:** Metrics calculated on historical data might not fully capture real-world performance. Consider conducting online evaluations (e.g., A/B testing) to validate these results with actual user interactions.
3. **Generalization:** Ensure that the model generalizes well to new users and items, particularly addressing the cold-start problem.


## Files
The following files are contained in this repo
- A presentation titled `Final Business Proposal.pptx` which contains our business proposal
- A presentation `Presentation.pdf` which explains our solution, including the business problem we aim to solve
- A notebook `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb`, which contains the engine's code

To execute this notebook, the files `movie.csv` and `rating.csv` must be downloaded from the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). Those files aren't included because of size limitation issues.
